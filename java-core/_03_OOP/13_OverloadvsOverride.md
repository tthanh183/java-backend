### The difference between overloading and overriding in Java

| Overloading                                                                                                       | Overriding                                                                                                                          |

| Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. | Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. |
| Overloading is also known as compile-time polymorphism.                                                           | Overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism.                                                                                   |
| Overloading is achieved by the compiler based on the method signature.                                            | Overriding is achieved by the JVM based on the object used to call the method.                                                      |
| Overloading is used to create multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.                       | Overriding is used to provide a specific implementation for a method in a subclass.                                                 |
| Overloading is used to expose behavior of an object.                                                              | Overriding is used to expose behavior of an object.                                                                                 |
| Overloading is used to initialize an object.                                                                      | Overriding is used to initialize an object.                                                                                         |
| Overloading is used to create multiple constructors in the same class with different parameter lists.             | Overriding is used to call a method from the parent class.                                                                          |
| Overloading is used to differentiate methods based on the number and type of parameters passed.                   | Overriding is used to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.                     |
