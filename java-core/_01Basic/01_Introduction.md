### Introduction to Java
- **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) is the Java virtual machine - it executes bytecode into machine code.
- **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) is the runtime environment, which includes the JVM and various libraries and files used by the JVM during runtime.
- **JDK** (Java Development Kit) is a set of tools that helps developers build Java applications, including the JRE and development tools.
- **JVM**, **JRE**, and **JDK** are platform-dependent, because the configuration of each operating system (OS) is different. However, Java is platform-independent.
- **Compilation**: Translates the entire file at once, then uses the result without needing to recompile.
- **Interpretation**: Translates and executes each line of code one by one.

> [!NOTE]
> From a `.Java` file, it is compiled into a `.class` file.  
> From the `.class` file, the JVM interprets it into machine code.
