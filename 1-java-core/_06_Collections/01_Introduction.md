### Introduction to Collections

1. **Collection and Collections**

"Collection" and "Collections" in Java are two distinct concepts.

- `Collections` in Java is a framework that provides an architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Any operations like searching, sorting, inserting, deleting, etc., can be performed on data using Java Collections.
- `Collection` in Java is a root interface in the collection hierarchy. The Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque, etc.) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, etc.).

2. **Collection Hierarchy in Java**

Hereâ€™s an overview of the main interfaces in the Collection hierarchy:

- `Set`: A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It is used to represent a set, such as a deck of cards, a student timetable, or running processes in a computer.

- `List`: A collection that maintains order (sometimes referred to as a sequence). Lists can contain duplicate elements, and elements can be accessed by index (position in the list).

- `Queue`: A collection used to hold multiple elements before processing. In addition to the basic collection operations, a Queue provides additional operations like adding, removing, and inspecting elements. It follows the FIFO (first-in, first-out) principle.

- `Deque`: A collection used to hold multiple elements before processing, with additional operations for adding, removing, and inspecting elements. A Deque can function as both FIFO (first-in, first-out) and LIFO (last-in, first-out). In a Deque, elements can be added and removed from both ends.

- `Map`: An object that maps each key to a value. A Map cannot contain duplicate keys. Each key maps to at most one value.

There are also two sorted interfaces for Set and Map:

- `SortedSet`: A Set that contains elements in a natural order (ascending order).
- `SortedMap`: A Map that contains elements sorted by their keys.

3. **Iterable and Iterator**

- `Iterable`: The `Iterable` interface is the root interface for all collection classes. It provides a single method, `iterator()`, which returns an `Iterator` object that can be used to iterate over the collection.
- `Iterator`: The `Iterator` interface provides methods to iterate over a collection. It allows you to traverse the collection, access the elements, and remove elements while iterating.

Methods in the `Iterator` interface:
- `hasNext()`: Returns `true` if there are more elements in the collection.
- `next()`: Returns the next element in the collection.
- `remove()`: Removes the last element returned by `next()` from the collection.

4. **Collections Utility Class**

6. **Generics and Non-Generics**

Before Java 5, collections were non-generic, meaning they could store any type of object. From Java 5 onwards, generics were introduced to provide type safety and eliminate the need for explicit type casting.
