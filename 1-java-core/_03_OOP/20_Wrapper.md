### Wrapper Class in Java

The Wrapper class in Java provides a mechanism to convert primitive data types into objects and converting objects back into primitive data types.

Since J2SE 5.0, the features of autoboxing and unboxing have automatically converted primitive data types to objects. The automatic conversion from primitive data types to objects is called autoboxing, and the reverse conversion from objects to primitive data types is called unboxing.
