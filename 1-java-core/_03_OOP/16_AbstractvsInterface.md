### Difference between Abstract class and Interface

| Abstract class                                                                 | Interface                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.                  | An interface can have only abstract methods.                                   |
| An abstract class can have constructors.                                       | An interface cannot have constructors.                                         |
| An abstract class can have instance variables.                                 | An interface cannot have instance variables.                                   |
| An abstract class can have static methods.                                     | An interface cannot have static methods.                                       |
| An abstract class can have main() method.                                      | An interface cannot have main() method.                                        |
| An abstract class can have final, non-final, static, and non-static variables. | An interface can have only static and final variables.                         |
| An abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface.             | An interface cannot provide the implementation of the abstract class.          |
| An abstract class can extend another class and implement multiple interfaces.  | An interface can extend multiple interfaces but cannot extends abstract class. |
