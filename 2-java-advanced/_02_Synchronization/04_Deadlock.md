### Deadlock in Java

Deadlock in Java is a part of multithreading. Deadlock can occur when one thread is waiting for an object lock held by another thread, and the second thread is waiting for an object lock held by the first thread. Since both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, this situation is called a deadlock.
