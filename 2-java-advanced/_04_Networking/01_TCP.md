### TCP/IP Protocol

What is the TCP/IP Protocol?

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is a set of protocols that control communication between all computers on the Internet. Specifically, TCP/IP specifies how information (or packets) is packaged, sent, and received by computers connected to one another. TCP/IP was developed in 1978 by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf.

How does the TCP/IP protocol work?

As its name suggests, TCP/IP is a combination of two separate protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet Protocol allows packets to be sent across the network; it specifies where the packets are to be sent and how to get there. IP has a method that enables any computer on the Internet to forward a packet to another computer through one or more hops (transfers) near the recipient. You can think of it as workers in a conveyor system transferring materials from a quarry to a truck.

The Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for ensuring reliable data transmission over connected networks. TCP checks the packets for errors and sends a request for retransmission if errors are found.

The most common TCP/IP Protocols:

- HTTP: Used between a web client and a web server to transmit data insecurely. A web client (such as a browser on a computer) sends a request to a web server to view a webpage. The web server receives the request and sends the webpage information back to the web client.
- HTTPS: Used between a web client and a web server to transmit data securely. It is often used to send credit card transaction data or other personal information from a web client (e.g., a browser) to a web server.
- FTP: Used between two or more computers. One computer sends or receives data directly to/from another computer.


Domain Name and IP Address:

The TCP/IP address of a website or web server is often hard to remember. To solve this problem, a domain name is used as a replacement. For example, 216.58.216.164 is one of Google's IP addresses, while google.com is the domain name. By using this method, instead of a series of numbers, users can more easily remember the web address of viettuts.vn.

How to Check the IP Address on Windows:

Press the Windows key + R, in the window that appears, type "cmd" into the textbox, then click "OK" or press Enter.

In the command-line interface, type the command ipconfig /all and press Enter.
