### FTP Protocol

What is FTP?

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is used for exchanging files over the Internet by utilizing TCP/IP protocols. FTP uses a client-server architecture and is often secured with SSL/TLS. It allows files to be shared between remote computers, providing reliable and efficient data transfer.

What is FTP used for?

FTP is most commonly used to transfer data from a client to a server and vice versa. A typical example is when a user creates their website on a personal computer and then uses FTP to upload the website files to the server. FTP can also be used to transfer files between two personal computers. With FTP, you can transfer one or multiple files at once.

Once you open the FTP client, you will have an interface like this:

In this interface, there are 4 fields that you need to enter:

Port: The default FTP port is 21, so you don't need to enter this.
After entering the information, click "Quickconnect" to connect to your hosting.
