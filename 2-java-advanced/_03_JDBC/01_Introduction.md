### JDBC

**What is Java JDBC?**

Java JDBC is a Java API used to connect to and execute queries on a database. The JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect to the database.

**Why use JDBC?**

Before JDBC, ODBC API was a database API used for connecting to and executing queries on databases. However, ODBC API uses ODBC drivers written in the C language (which is platform-dependent and unsafe). This is why Java defined its own API (JDBC API) using JDBC drivers (written in Java).

**What is an API?**

API (Application Programming Interface) is a document that contains descriptions of all the features of a product or software. It represents the classes and interfaces that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. An API can be created for applications, libraries, operating systems, and more.
