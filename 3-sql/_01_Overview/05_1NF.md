### First Normal Form (1NF)

First Normal Form (1NF) sets the basic rules to organize the data in a database. A database is said to be in first normal form if it satisfies the following conditions:
- Rule 1 (Atomic Values) − Every column of a table should contain only atomic values. An atomic value is a value that cannot be divided further.
- Rule 2 (No Repeating Groups) − There are no repeating groups of data. This means a table should not contain repeating columns.

Example: Atomic Values

| StudentID | StudentName | Subjects |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1         | John        | Math, Science, English |
| 2         | Jane        | Math, Science, English |
    
The above table does not satisfy the first normal form because the Subjects column contains multiple values. To convert this table into 1NF, we need to break the Subjects column into separate rows.

| StudentID | StudentName | Subjects |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1         | John        | Math     |
| 1         | John        | Science  |
| 1         | John        | English  |
| 2         | Jane        | Math     |
| 2         | Jane        | Science  |
| 2         | Jane        | English  |

Example: No Repeating Groups

| StudentID | StudentName | Subjects1 | Subjects2 | Subjects3 |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | John        | Math      | Science   | English   |
| 2         | Jane        | Math      | Science   | English   |
    
The above table does not satisfy the first normal form because the Subjects1, Subjects2, and Subjects3 columns contain repeating groups of data. To convert this table into 1NF, we need to break the Subjects columns into separate rows.

| StudentID | StudentName | Subjects |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1         | John        | Math     |
| 1         | John        | Science  |
| 1         | John        | English  |
| 2         | Jane        | Math     |
| 2         | Jane        | Science  |
| 2         | Jane        | English  |
