### Third Normal Form (3NF)

A table is in a third normal form when the following conditions are met:
- It is in 2NF
- All nonprimary fields are dependent on the primary key.

Example:
```
Table: Employee

EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department | DepartmentLocation
1          | John         | HR         | New York
2          | Jane         | HR         | New York
3          | Jack         | IT         | San Francisco
```

In the above table, the DepartmentLocation is dependent on the Department, not on the EmployeeID. So, the table is in 3NF. To convert this table into 3NF, we need to break the table into two separate tables.

Table 1: Employee

```
EmployeeID | EmployeeName | Department
1          | John         | HR
2          | Jane         | HR
3          | Jack         | IT
```

Table 2: Department

```
Department | DepartmentLocation
HR         | New York
IT         | San Francisco
```
