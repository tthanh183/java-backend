### Operators

An SQL operator is a reserved word or a character used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operation(s), such as comparisons and arithmetic operations. These Operators are used to specify conditions in an SQL statement and to serve as conjunctions for multiple conditions in a statement.

An SQL operator can be either a unary or binary operator. A unary operator (example unary + or unary - ) uses only one operand to perform the unary operation, whereas the binary operator (example + or - etc) uses two operands to perform the binary operation.

Types of Operators in SQL:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**

| Operator | Description    |
|----------|----------------|
| +        | Addition       |
| -        | Subtraction    |
| *        | Multiplication |
| /        | Division       |
| %        | Modulo         |

2. **Comparison Operators**

| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| =        | Equal to                 |
| <>       | Not equal to             |
| >        | Greater than             |
| <        | Less than                |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
    
3. **Logical Operators**

| Operator | Description                                                  |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ALL      | TRUE if all of the subquery values meet the condition        |
| AND      | TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE          |
| ANY      | TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition        |
| BETWEEN  | TRUE if the operand is within the range of comparisons       |
| EXISTS   | TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records             |
| IN       | TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions |
| LIKE     | TRUE if the operand matches a pattern                        |
| NOT      | Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE            |
| OR       | TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE        |
| IS NULL  | TRUE if the operand is NULL                                  |
