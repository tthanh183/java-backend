### Union All Operator

UNION and UNION ALL operators are just the SQL implementation of algebraic set operators. Both of them are used to retrieve the rows from multiple tables and return them as one single table. The difference between these two operators is that UNION only returns distinct rows while UNION ALL returns all the rows present in the tables.
