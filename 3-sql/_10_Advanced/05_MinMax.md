### Min, Max 

The MIN() and MAX() functions in SQL are aggregate functions. They are used to compare values in a set and, retrieve the maximum and minimum values respectively.

MAX() and MIN() aggregate functions are generally used in two ways:
- As functions, they are used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.
- As expressions, they are used with a subquery and HAVING clause of SELECT statement.

Syntax:
```sql
MAX(expression)
MIN(expression)
```
