### Common Table Expressions (CTE)

A Common Table Expression (CTE) can make it easier to manage and write complex queries by making them more readable and simple, like database views and derived tables. We can reuse or rewrite the query by breaking down the complex queries into simple blocks.

The WITH clause in MySQL is used to specify a Common Table Expression.

A Common Table Expression (CTE) in SQL is a one-time result set, i.e. it is a temporary table that exists only during the execution of a single query. It allows us to work with data specifically within that query, such as using it in SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, CREATE, VIEW, OR MERGE statements.

Syntax:
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM cte_name;
```

Explanation:
- cte_name is excuted first and the result is stored in a temporary table.
- The result of the cte_name is used in the SELECT statement.


Advantages of CTE:
- CTE makes the code maintenance easier.
- It increases the readability of the code.
- It increases the performance of the query.
- CTE allows for the simple implementation of recursive queries.

Disadvantages of CTE:
- CTE can only be referenced once by the recursive member.
- We cannot use the table variables and CTEs as parameters in a stored procedure.
- A CTE can be used in place of a view, but a CTE cannot be nested while views can.
