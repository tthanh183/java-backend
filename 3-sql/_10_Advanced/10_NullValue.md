### Null Value

SQL uses the term NULL to represent a non-existent data value in the database. These values are not the same as an empty string or a zero. They don't hold any space in the database and are used to signify the absence of a value or the unknown value in a data field.

> [!NOTE]  
> Since the NULL values are basically non-existent, you cannot use comparison operators such as = , <, or > with them. However, you can check if a value is NULL using the IS NULL, "NOT NULL" or IS NOT NULL operators.
