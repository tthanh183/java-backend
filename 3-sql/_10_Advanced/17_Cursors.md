### Cursors in SQL

A Cursor is a temporary memory that is allocated by the database server at the time of performing the Data Manipulation Language operations on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE etc. It is used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in the SQL table.

> [!NOTE]  
> In MySQL, you cannot declare a cursor directly outside of a stored procedure or function. Cursors are generally declared within stored procedures, functions, or blocks of SQL code in MySQL database.

I dont` know what to do with this note. I think it is not necessary. I will remove it.
