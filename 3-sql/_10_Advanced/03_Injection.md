### Injection (SQL)

SQL Injection is a type of security attack that exploits a vulnerability in a database by executing malicious queries. This will allow attackers to access sensitive data, tamper it and also delete it permanently.

Injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their name and instead of a name they give you a SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database. Never trust user provided data, process this data only after validation; as a rule, this is done by Pattern Matching.
