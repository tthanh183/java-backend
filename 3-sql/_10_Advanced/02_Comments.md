### Comments 

In SQL, comments can be used to explain a particular section of a query; or to skip the execution of statement. So, whenever a line of code is marked as a comment in a program, it is not executed.

There are two types of comments used in MySQL database, they are as follows:
- Single-line comments
- Multi-line comments

1. **Single-line comments**: Single-line comments start with `--` or `#` and continue until the end of the line. For example:
```sql
-- This is a single-line comment
# This is also a single-line comment
```

2. **Multi-line comments**: Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. For example:
```sql
/* This is a multi-line comment */
```
