### Left Join vs Right Join

| Left Join                                                                                                                                                                     | Right Join                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Left Join matches the data of the first table or the left table with the data in second table. If the data is matched, the records are combined; otherwise, NULL is recorded. | Right Join matches the data of the second table or right table with the data in first table. If the data is matched, the records are combined; otherwise, NULL is recorded. |
| If the first table has less rows than the second table, extra unmatched rows from the second table are discarded.                                                             | If the second table has less rows than the first table, extra unmatched rows from the first table are discarded.                                                            |
| This Join is also known as Left Outer Join	                                                                                                                                   | This Join is also known as Right Outer Join.                                                                                                                                |
| *= is used in Transact SQL, instead of using the LEFT JOIN or LEFT OUTER JOIN query.                                                                                          | *= is used in Transact SQL, instead of using the RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN query.                                                                                      |
