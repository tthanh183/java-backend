### Create Database

A database is a structured collection of data that is stored in a computer system. They are used to store and retrieve the data efficiently. Databases can be created using different query languages, and SQL is one such language.

- Create Database:  

The Create Databasestatement is a DDL (Data Definition Language) statement used to create a new database in SQL. If you are creating your database on Linux or Unix, then database names are case-sensitive, even though SQL keywords are case-insensitive. If you are working on Windows then this restriction does not apply.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

- List Databases:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

- Use Database:

```sql
USE database_name;
```
